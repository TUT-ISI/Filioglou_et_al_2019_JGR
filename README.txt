This module relates to the paper entitled "Aerosol effect on the cloud phase of low-level clouds over the Arctic" submitted at the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres in 2019:

Filioglou, M., Mielonen, T., Balis, D., Giannakaki, E., Arola, A., Kokkola, H., Komppula, M., & Romakkaniemi, S. (2019). Aerosol effect on the cloud phase of low-level clouds over the Arctic. Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres [Submitted] 

Use the CloudSat_Calipso_Synergy_MAIN.m to read and collocate data from the two satellites according to the methodology described in the paper. This code also calls a number of subroutines which allows to reproduce the figures as in Filioglou et al., (2019), JGR 
You would need to have the publicly available satellite data to a local repository in order to use this code. 
The satellite data can be found here:
